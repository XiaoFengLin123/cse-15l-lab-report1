An example of using the command with no arguments
![Image](cd example 1.jpg)

The absolute path to the working directory before the command was run: `/c/Users/capta/lecture1`
When cd is used without any arguments, it changes the current working directory to the home directory. which in my case, it went to `/c/Users/capta`, which is my home directory
