The absolute path to the working directory before the command was run: `/c/Users/capta/lecture1`
When `cd` is used without arguments, the current working directory is changed to the home directory. which, in my case, it went to `/c/Users/capta`, which is my home directory
Having no arguments means entering the `cd` command without additional information. This performs the default operation of changing the directory to the user's home directory. 
There is no error in this case since if `cd` is not provided with any arguments, the working directory will be changed to the user's home directory.
